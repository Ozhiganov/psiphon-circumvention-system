Psiphon Circumvention Tool README
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Psiphon Circumvention Tool is a simple, proxy-based system designed to
circumvent Internet censorship.

The system consists of a client application, which configures a users computer
to direct Internet traffic; and a set of servers, which proxy client traffic to
the Internet. As long as a client can connect to a Psiphon server, it can
access Internet services that may be blocked to the user via direct connection.

Features:

- Automatic discovery. Psiphon clients ship with a set of known Psiphon servers
to connect to. Over time, clients discover additional servers that are added to
a backup server list. As older servers become blocked, each client will have a
reserve list of new servers to draw from as it reconnects. To ensure that an
adversary cannot enumerate and block a large number of servers, the Psiphon
system takes special measures to control how many servers may be discovered by
a single client.

- Mobile ready. A Psiphon client Android app will be available as part of the
beta launch, and other mobile platforms are in the works.

- Zero install. Psiphon is delivered to users as a minimal footprint, zero
install application that can be downloaded from any webpage, file sharing site
or shared by e-mail and passed around on a USB key. We keep the file size small
and avoid the overhead of having to install an application.

- Custom branding.  Psiphon offers a flexible sponsorship system which includes
sponsor-branded clients. Dynamic branding includes graphics and text on the
client UI; and a region-specific dynamic homepage mechanism that allows a
different home page to open depending on where in the world the client is run.

- Chain of trust. Each client instance may be digitally signed to certify its
authenticity. Embedded server certificates certify that Psiphon servers the
client connects to are the authentic servers for that client.

- Privacy. Psiphon is designed to respect user privacy. User statistics are
logged in aggregate, but no individual personally identifying information, such
as user IP addresses, are retained in PsiphonV log files.

Coming soon:

- Agile transport. Psiphon features a pluggable architecture with multiple
transport mechanisms, including VPN and SSH tunneling. In the case where one
transport protocol is blocked by a censor, Psiphon automatically switches over
to another mechanism.

- IPv6 compatibility.  Psiphon is designed to be IPv6 compatible. This ensures
the system is ready for the next generation Internet, and in the immediate term
offers some additional circumvention capabilities as IPv6-based censorship lags
behind the tools used to censor IPv4 traffic.
