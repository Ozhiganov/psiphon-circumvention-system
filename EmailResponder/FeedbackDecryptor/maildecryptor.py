'''
Periodically checks feedback email. There are three types of email:
  1. Not related to diagnostic info at all. Disregard.
  2. Has diagnostic attachment. Decrypt attachment and store in the
     diagnostic-info-DB. Store email message ID and diagnostic info ID (and
     subject) in email-ID-DB.
  3. Has diagnostic info ID, but no attachment. Store email message ID and
     diagnostic info ID (and subject) in email-ID-DB.
