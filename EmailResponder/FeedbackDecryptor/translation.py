'''
We're creating our own Google Translate interface for two reasons:
- The lesser reason: The Google API Python lib sends requests that are too
  long (and so get a response error), so we'd have to wrap it anyway.
- The greater reason: Requests to the API timeout *a lot*. We need to have
  some failover between IP addresses. We'll be using `/etc/hosts` to help us.

We have found that `www.googleapis.com` resolves to different IPs from
different geographical regions, and that when one IP is failing, the other
IP(s) is often still working. So we'll leverage those multiple IPs to make our
requests more robust.

Note that `/etc/hosts` has to have entries for every `apiServers` alias. The
aliases must be of the form `[a-z0-9]+.googleapis.com`, because the SSL
certificate will only match `*.googleapis.com`.

If you don't want any failover, just leave `apiServers` empty or None.

    # This is a bit tricky. A unicode string of a particular length will
